# CSE340-DIP

# Introduction
Digital Image Processing is a domain where we learn about different algorithms and methods to process the images. For example, removing noise from images, interpolating the missing pixel values, performing different transformations over image and learning to exploit the spatial and fourier domains of the digital image are some of the conecpts we learned in the course.

The above assignments deal with various applications. They contain both theory and coding questions. One may slide into the 'Submitted' folder of each assignment to look at the solutions and implementations of different algorithms.

# Steps to run
- Download the file that you wish to run.
- Download the required images as given in each folder.
- Rename the names of the images according to the downloaded images.
- Try to keep the images and code files in the same folder.
- Navigate to the folder using a command line.
- Run the python file.
- All the questions will run one after the another. 
- Input the requirements whenever prompted.
- Make sure to close the output windows to proceed to the next output.
- The program will throw the desired outputs one after the another.
